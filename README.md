# VertexFinder.jl

The need to determine pseudoperipheral vertices arises from several graph-
theoretical approaches for ordering sparse matrix equations. This package
implements George-Liu algorithm for finding a pseudoperipheral vertex in a graph
aiming at returning a vertex having a large eccentricity.
